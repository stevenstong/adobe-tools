IHTTPLinkResourceConnection deals with connection details of the server.
It contains function related to connection with server. Use this interface to implement logic
related to login details, passing session token etc. This interface is largely for client plugin usage
to handle connection related operations.
 
To subclass create a boss based on kHTTPAssetLinkResourceHelperBoss with the implementation of this
interface. And return this connection instance from the IHTTPLinkSubsystemObjectFactory. It is
mandatory to implement this interface for creating new plugin to handle particular scheme.
