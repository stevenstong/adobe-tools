Adobe InDesign Plug-in SDK 

This plug-in SDK provides documentation and tools for
developing, debugging and testing InDesign, InCopy and
InDesign Server plug-ins.

Note: Historically, a seperate set of tools and documentation
	  was available in a package called the InDesign Tool Kit
	  (ITK). The ITK and plug-in SDK have now been combined 
	  and are provided together in this plug-in SDK.

Debug symbols are available seperately.
